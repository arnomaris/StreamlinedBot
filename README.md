# StreamlinedBot

StreamlinedBot is a Discord bot designed for the the [Streamlined Discord](discord.gg/streamlined). It can host anonymous photocontests, general utilities and social media link management.

## Features

### Photo Contest System
- Anonymous submissions: Users can participate in the contest by using the command `/photocontest submit`.
- Voting system: Users can vote on submissions.
- Moderation tools: Staff can manage contests, remove submissions easily and track votes.

### What I plan on adding
- Use RSS feeds to automatically post new social media content.

# What I learned

This project helped me improve my knowledge of JavaScript and taught me how to:
- Use promises properly
- Work with the Discord.js library
- Design modular command structures (which I since have used in other projects)
- Handle database operations with MySQL
- Host applications on Heroku

This has always been a fun project for me, instead of relying on popular Discord bots, I saw it as challenge to write the features we required myself.

## Contributing

This bot is designed for the Streamlined Discord, if you wish to use the photocontest feature for your own Discord. Feel free to contact me. *Note: I will not cover costs of hosting this for you.*
